SUPER-PROMPT ‚Äî Build Volcy (iPhone-first, on-device ML) + Web Companion (view-only)
Mission

Hey Claude, please help me build this application! Details below:

Volcy, an iPhone app that delivers millimeter-accurate skin analytics from in-app scans: per-lesion diameter (mm), redness (Œîa*), elevation (mm), volume proxy (mm¬≥), healing rate (%/day), region stats, and regimen A/B. All inference on device. Sync metrics only (no photos/depth) to a web companion dashboard. Production-grade quality, privacy-first.

Non-negotiables (design constraints)

iPhone is the source of truth: capture only via in-app camera (no photo uploads anywhere).

On-device ML: Core ML inference; never send images or depth to servers.

Metrics-only sync for web dashboard (charts, trends, regimen logs).

Strict QC before capture (pose, distance, glare, white balance, blur).

No diagnosis; wellness tracking language only.

Privacy by default; local storage for media, export/delete controls.

Platforms & Tech

iOS app: Swift 5.9+, SwiftUI, Combine, ARKit (TrueDepth/LiDAR), AVFoundation, Vision, Core Image, Core ML, Accelerate/BNNS, PDFKit, StoreKit 2, BackgroundTasks, App Intents.

Local data: Core Data (SQLite) for scans/lesions/regimen + FileManager for media (HEIC, depth).

Sync backend (metrics only): Prefer CloudKit (private DB; simplest, privacy-first). Alternative (if cross-platform auth needed): Supabase/Postgres or Firebase, but still metrics-only.

Web companion (view-only): Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui on Vercel. Auth via Sign in with Apple (Web). Reads metrics from CloudKit JS or your API.

CI/CD: Xcode Cloud or fastlane; TestFlight; App Store Connect; code signing auto-managed.

Observability: os_log + MetricKit, XCTest + XCUITests, crash reports (Apple), optional privacy-preserving analytics.
